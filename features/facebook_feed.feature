Feature: Include a Facebook Feed on the Home Page

	As an admin
	So that volunteers can see our Facebook updates
	I want to have our Facebook feed on our home page

  	
Scenario: should see the facebook feed on home page 
  Given I am on the FSD-Training-Site home page
  Then I should see "facebook"
